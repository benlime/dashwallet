Analysis Dashboard for Trail Wallet (http://voyagetravelapps.com/trail-wallet)

## This project is WIP
This project is *WIP* and currently in active development. I'll update the readme if it is ready to use.

## Why?
The analytics given provided in the Trail Wallet app are good, but if you are using tags the analytic feature are not as rich as they could be. The goal is to provide a a graphical analytics dashboard with different charts which I will use to analyze my expenses further after my trips. Additionally the charts will be the basis for some further blog posts on my travel budgeting to help other travellers who are planning a trip. https://honeytrail.de

## How does it work?
Trail Wallet has the awesome capability to export the whole travel expendes to a `CSV` file. You can then use this file to send it to `dashwallet` which will present you a rich analytics dashboard. The easiest way to upload the exported `CSV` to `dashwallet` would be to create a workflow using the Workflow iOS App (http://workflow.is) and run it out of Trail Wallet with the exported file. A workflow template will be provided as soon as the project is ready.
